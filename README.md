# Medical Insurance Cost Predictor

A fully deployed, end‑to‑end machine learning project that predicts annual medical insurance charges using linear regression. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment using Streamlit, and interpretability through feature contribution analysis.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Live App:** **


## 📘 Project Overview

Insurance companies estimate medical charges using various personal factors. This project builds a simple but effective predictive model that:

* Learns patterns from historical medical cost data
* Predicts the expected annual medical charges for a new patient
* Provides clear feature‑level explanations of the prediction
* Runs as a clean, interactive Streamlit web app

---

## 🧵 Dataset

**Source:** Kaggle — Medical Cost Personal Dataset
**Rows:** 1,338
**Features:**

* `age` — age of the patient
* `sex` — male/female
* `bmi` — body mass index
* `children` — dependents
* `smoker` — yes/no
* `region` — northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest
* `charges` — medical cost billed (target)

This dataset is noisy, skewed, and contains large real-world variability — making it a good test for regression.

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed:

* Distribution of charges
* Scatter plots (age vs charges, BMI vs charges)
* Boxplots (smoker vs charges)
* Correlation heatmap

**Key Insights:**

* Smoking is the single largest cost driver
* Age shows moderate positive correlation
* BMI shows slight-to-moderate positive correlation
* Sex and region have minimal predictive impact

---

### 2. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Steps taken:

* Converted categorical variables (sex, smoker) into binary indicators
* One-hot encoded region
* Added optional interaction feature: `bmi_x_smoker`
* Dropped original string columns

Final numerical features ready for model training.

---

### 3. Model Training

**Algorithm:** Linear Regression (scikit-learn)
**Train/Test Split:** 80/20

The model learns simple linear relationships between input features and charges. Coefficients are easy to interpret, making the model transparent.

## 📈 Model Performance

Baseline model (predicting mean cost only):

* **MAE:** ~9861.80

Linear Regression model results:

* **MAE:** ~4177.04
* **RMSE:** ~5956.34
* **R²:** ~0.81

**Conclusion:**
The model reduces error by **~58%**, and explains **~80% of the variance**. This is strong performance for this dataset.

## 🔍 Feature Importance & Interpretation

Top contributors:

* **smoker_yes** — largest effect (~+$23k)
* **age** — older patients → higher cost
* **bmi** — higher BMI → moderate cost increase
* **children** — minor effect
* **sex / region** — very small influence

These match the patterns observed in EDA.

## 🖥 Web App (Streamlit)

The front-end is an interactive Streamlit application that allows users to:

* Enter patient details using sliders and dropdowns
* Generate predicted medical costs instantly
* View feature contributions for transparency
* Visualize dataset distributions (optional)

Run locally:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone <repo-url>
cd medical_cost_prediction
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Streamlit app:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📉 Limitations

* Linear regression struggles with extreme outliers
* Model is limited by available features — missing health history, medications, income, etc.
* Predictions are point estimates without uncertainty bands (optional to add)
* Dataset may not generalize to real insurance pricing rules

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Implement Random Forest / Gradient Boosting for better handling of nonlinearity
* Use log-transformed target to reduce heteroscedasticity
* Add SHAP explanations
* Add batch CSV upload in the app
* Build a REST API version using FastAPI
